# income_census
classification  model to predict whether a person earns more than $50k  per year or not


This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). 
A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)). 
The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year.
